# ORE Creator

**ORE Creator** is a rewards program for content creators who publish content about ORE on social media. The program receives yield generated by the ORE boost program and distributes it to creators according to their current content "score". Score can be calculated by an off-chain oracle which aggregates and reviews creator content based on impressions, engagement, and sentiment.
