# ORE Promo

**ORE Promo** is a rewards program for content creators who share content about ORE on social media. The program collects yield generated by the ORE boost program and distributes it to creators according to their current content "score". Score can be calculated by an off-chain oracle which aggregates and reviews creator content based on impressions, engagement, and sentiment.
